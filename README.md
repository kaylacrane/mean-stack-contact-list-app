# MEAN Stack Contact List

- **M**: MongoDB for storing the contact list
- **E**: ExpressJS for helping with API setup
- **A**: Angular for the frontend interface
- **N**: NodeJs as backend runtime environment

The API runs on <http://localhost:3000/>
The frontend form is on <http://localhost:4200/>

The Angular interface allows users to create, update, delete, and list contacts (CRUD).
Contact data is validated on both front and back end.
A proxy has been set up to keep backend endpoint hidden.
